.SH NAME
.PP
\fBrofi\fP - A window switcher, application launcher, ssh dialog, dmenu
replacement and more

.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBrofi\fP [ -show \fImode\fP ]|[ -dmenu ]|[ -e \fImsg\fP ] [ CONFIGURATION ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBrofi\fP is an X11 pop-up window switcher, run dialog, dmenu replacement, and
more. It focuses on being fast to use and have minimal distraction. It supports
keyboard and mouse navigation, type to filter, tokenized search and more.

.SH USAGE
.PP
\fBrofi\fP\&'s main functionality is to assist in your workflow, allowing you to
quickly switch between windows, start applications or log into a remote machine
via \fBssh\fR\&. There are different \fImodes\fP for different types of actions. \fBrofi\fP
is a standalone application and should not be integrated into scripts. For
integration into scripts it has a special mode that functions as a (drop-in)
replacement for \fBdmenu(1)\fP\&. See emulating dmenu below.

.SS Running rofi
.PP
To launch \fBrofi\fP directly in a certain mode, specify a mode with \fBrofi -show
<mode>\fR\&. To show the \fBdrun\fR dialog:

.EX
    rofi -show drun

.EE

.PP
A useful setup in minimalistic window managers is to combine \fBdrun\fR, \fBrun\fR
with \fBwindow\fR mode:

.EX
  rofi -show combi -modes combi -combi-modes "window,drun,run"

.EE

.PP
In this setup it first list all open applications, then all installed
applications. So if you type firefox and hit return, it will switch to the
running firefox, or launch it when it is not running.

.SS Emulating dmenu
.PP
\fBrofi\fP can emulate \fBdmenu(1)\fP (a dynamic menu for X11) when launched with
the \fB-dmenu\fR flag.

.PP
For more information see \fBrofi-dmenu(5)\fP\&.

.SS Display Error message
.PP
\fBrofi\fP error dialog can also be called from the command line.

.EX
    rofi -e "my message"

.EE

.PP
Markup support can be enabled, see CONFIGURATION options.

.SH CONFIGURATION
.PP
There are currently three methods of setting configuration options (evaluated
in order below):

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
System configuration file  (for example \fB/etc/rofi.rasi\fR). It first checks
\fBXDG_CONFIG_DIRS\fR, and then \fBSYSCONFDIR\fR (that is passed at compile time).
It loads the first config file it finds, it does not merge multiple system
configuration files.
.IP \(bu 2
Rasi theme file: The new \fItheme\fP format can be used to set configuration
values.
.IP \(bu 2
Command-line options: Arguments passed to \fBrofi\fP\&.

.RE

.PP
To get a template config file, run: \fBrofi -dump-config > config.rasi\fR

.PP
This will contain (commented) all current configuration options, modified
options are uncommented.

.PP
To get a template config file that sets the icon-theme run: \fBrofi -icon-theme
hicolor -dump-config\fR\&.

.PP
It is \fBstrongly\fP recommended to use this as a starting point for your
configuration.

.PP
An empty configuration section in the config file looks like:

.EX
configuration {
 // set config options here
}

.EE

.PP
Most of the configuration options mentioned below (beside options like \fB-show\fR,
\fB-dump-config\fR that apply to a single run) can be set here.

.PP
For example to set the dpi value to 72:

.EX
configuration {
	dpi: 72;
}

.EE

.PP
The configuration system supports the following types:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
string
.IP \(bu 2
integer (signed and unsigned)
.IP \(bu 2
char
.IP \(bu 2
boolean
.IP \(bu 2
lists

.RE

.PP
For the syntax of these options, see the \fBrofi-theme(5)\fP manpage.

.PP
For use on the command line, Boolean options have a non-default command-line
syntax. Example to enable option X:

.EX
    -X

.EE

.PP
To disable option X:

.EX
    -no-X

.EE

.PP
Below is a list of the most important options:

.SS General
.PP
\fB-help\fR

.PP
The help option shows the full list of command-line options and the current set
values. These include dynamic (run-time generated) options.

.PP
\fB-version\fR

.PP
Show the \fBrofi\fP version and exit.

.PP
\fB-dump-config\fR

.PP
Dump the current active configuration, in rasi format, to stdout and exit.
Information about the rasi format can be found in the \fBrofi-theme(5)\fP manpage.

.PP
\fB-dump-theme\fR

.PP
Dump the current active theme, in rasi format, to stdout and exit.

.PP
\fB-rasi-validate\fR \fIfilename\fP

.PP
Try to parse the file and return 0 when successful, non-zero when failed.

.PP
\fB-list-keybindings\fR

.PP
List all known keybindings without trying to parse them. This can be used to
look for duplicate bindings.

.PP
\fB-threads\fR \fInum\fP

.PP
Specify the number of threads \fBrofi\fP should use:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
0: Autodetect the number of supported hardware threads.
.IP \(bu 2
1: Disable threading
.IP \(bu 2
2..n: Specify the maximum number of threads to use in the thread pool.

.RE

.PP
Default:  Autodetect

.PP
\fB-display\fR \fIdisplay\fP

.PP
The X server to contact. Default is \fB$DISPLAY\fR\&.

.PP
\fB-dmenu\fR

.PP
Run \fBrofi\fP in dmenu mode. This allows for interactive scripts.
In \fBdmenu\fR mode, \fBrofi\fP reads from STDIN, and output to STDOUT.
A simple example, displaying three pre-defined options:

.EX
    echo -e "Option #1\\nOption #2\\nOption #3" | rofi -dmenu

.EE

.PP
Or get the options from a script:

.EX
    ~/my_script.sh | rofi -dmenu

.EE

.PP
See the \fBrofi-dmenu(5)\fP manpage for more information.

.PP
\fB-show\fR \fImode\fP

.PP
Open \fBrofi\fP in a certain mode. Available modes are \fBwindow\fR, \fBrun\fR, \fBdrun\fR,
\fBssh\fR, \fBcombi\fR\&. The special argument \fBkeys\fR can be used to open a searchable
list of supported key bindings
(see the \fBrofi-keys(5)\fP manpage)

.PP
To show the run-dialog:

.EX
    rofi -show run

.EE

.PP
If \fB-show\fR is the last option passed to rofi, the first enabled modes is shown.

.PP
\fB-modes\fR \fImode1,mode2\fP

.PP
Specify an ordered, comma-separated list of modes to enable.
Enabled modes can be changed at runtime. Default key is \fBCtrl+Tab\fR\&.
If no modes are specified, all configured modes will be enabled.
To only show the \fBrun\fR and \fBssh\fR launcher:

.EX
    rofi -modes "run,ssh" -show run

.EE

.PP
Custom modes can be added using the internal \fBscript\fR mode. Each such mode has
two parameters:

.EX
<name>:<script>

.EE

.PP
Example: Have a mode called 'Workspaces' using the \fBi3_switch_workspaces.sh\fR
script:

.EX
    rofi -modes "window,run,ssh,Workspaces:i3_switch_workspaces.sh" -show Workspaces

.EE

.PP
Notes: The i3 window manager dislikes commas in the command when specifying an
exec command. For that case, \fB#\fR can be used as a separator.

.PP
\fBTIP\fP: The name is allowed to contain spaces:

.EX
    rofi -modes "My File Browser:fb.sh" -show "My File Browser"

.EE

.PP
\fB-case-sensitive\fR

.PP
Start in case-sensitive mode. This option can be changed at run-time using the
\fB-kb-toggle-case-sensitivity\fR key binding.

\fB-scroll-method\fR \fImethod\fP

.PP
Select the scrolling method. 0: Per page, 1: continuous.

.PP
\fB-normalize-match\fR

.PP
Normalize the string before matching, so \fBo\fR will match \fBö\fR, and \fBé\fR matches
\fBe\fR\&.  This is not a perfect implementation, but works. For now, it disables
highlighting of the matched part.

.PP
\fB-no-lazy-grab\fR

.PP

      fallback-icon: "<icon name>";
    }
}

.EE

.PP
Example

.EX
configuration {
    run,drun {

.SS Layout and Theming
.PP
\fBIMPORTANT:\fP In newer \fBrofi\fP releases, all the theming options have been
moved into the new theme format. They are no longer normal \fBrofi\fP options
that can be passed directly on the command line (there are too many). Small
snippets can be passed on the command line: \fBrofi -theme-str 'window {width:
50%;}'\fR to override a single setting. They are merged into the current theme.
They can also be appended at the end of the \fBrofi\fP config file to override
parts of the theme.

.PP
Most of the following options are \fBdeprecated\fP and should not be used. Please
use the new theme format to customize \fBrofi\fP\&. More information about the new
format can be found in the \fBrofi-theme(5)\fP manpage.

.SH PATTERN
.PP
To launch commands (for example, when using the ssh launcher), the user can
enter the used command-line. The following keys can be used that will be
replaced at runtime:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{host}\fR: the host to connect to
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{terminal}\fR: the configured terminal (see -terminal)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{ssh-client}\fR: the configured ssh client (see -ssh-client)
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{cmd}\fR: the command to execute
.IP \(bu 2
\fB{window}\fR: the window ID of the selected window (in \fBwindow-command\fR)

.RE

.PP
It processes the string as follows: \fB{key}\fR
is replaced by its value, if \fB{key}\fR is not set it is removed. If the \fB{key}\fR
is in between \fB[]\fR  all the text between \fB[]\fR is removed if \fB{key}\fR is not set.
Otherwise key is replaced and the \fB[]\fR are removed.

.PP
For example: \fB{ssh-client} [-p {port}] {host}\fR

.SH THEMING
.PP
Please see \fBrofi-theme(5)\fP manpage for more information on theming.

.SH KEY BINDINGS
.PP
Please see the \fBrofi-keys(5)\fP manpage for the keybindings and how to set them
up.

.PP
The keybinding can also be used for actions, when the action is executed the
mentioned keystroke is inserted:

.SS Timeout
.PP
You can configure an action to be taken when rofi has not been interacted
with for a certain amount of seconds. You can specify a keybinding to trigger
after X seconds.

.EX
configuration {
  timeout {
      delay:  15;
      action: "kb-cancel";
  }
}

.EE

.SS Input change

.EX
configuration {
  inputchange {
      action: "kb-row-first";
  }
}

.EE

.SH Available Modes
.SS window
.PP
Show a list of all the windows and allow switching between them. Pressing the
\fBdelete-entry\fR binding (\fBshift-delete\fR) will close the window. Pressing the
\fBaccept-custom\fR binding (\fBcontrol-enter\fR or \fBshift-enter\fR) will run a command
on the window. (See option \fBwindow-command\fR );

.PP
If there is no match, it will try to launch the input.

.SS windowcd
.PP
Shows a list of the windows on the current desktop and allows switching between
them. Pressing the \fBdelete-entry\fR binding (\fBshift-delete\fR) will kill the
window. Pressing the \fBaccept-custom\fR binding (\fBcontrol-enter\fR or \fBshift-enter\fR)
will run a command on the window. (See option \fBwindow-command\fR );

.PP
If there is no match, it will try to launch the input.

.SS run
.PP
Shows a list of executables in \fB$PATH\fR and can launch them (optional in a
terminal).

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Pressing the \fBdelete-entry\fR binding (\fBshift-delete\fR) will remove this entry
from the run history.
.IP \(bu 2
Pressing the \fBaccept-custom\fR binding (\fBcontrol-enter\fR) will run the command
as entered in the entry box.
.IP \(bu 2
Pressing the \fBaccept-alt\fR binding (\fBshift-enter\fR) will run the command in a
terminal.

.RE

.PP
When pressing the \fBmode-complete\fR binding (\fBControl-l\fR), you can use the File
Browser mode to launch the application with a file as the first argument.

.SS drun
.PP
Same as the \fBrun\fP launches, but the list is created from the installed
desktop files. It automatically launches them in a terminal if specified in the
Desktop File.

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Pressing the \fBdelete-entry\fR binding (\fBshift-delete\fR) will remove this entry
from the run history.
.IP \(bu 2
Pressing the \fBaccept-custom\fR binding (\fBcontrol-enter\fR) will run the command
as entered in the entry box.
.IP \(bu 2
Pressing the \fBaccept-alt\fR binding (\fBshift-enter\fR) will run the command in a
terminal.

.RE

.PP
When pressing the \fBmode-complete\fR binding (\fBControl-l\fR), you can use the File
Browser mode to launch the application passing a file as argument if specified
in the desktop file.

.PP
The DRUN mode tries to follow the XDG Desktop Entry
Specification
\[la]https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/desktop\-entry\-spec/\[ra]
and should be compatible with applications using this standard.  Some
applications create invalid desktop files, \fBrofi\fP will discard these entries.
See the debugging section for more info on DRUN mode, this will print why
desktop files are discarded.

.PP
There are a few advanced options to tweak the behaviour:

.EX
configuration {
   drun {
      /** Scan the current users desktop for desktop files. */
      scan-desktop: true;
      /** Parse user desktop files. */
      parse-user:   true;
      /** Parse system desktop files. */
      parse-system: false;
   }
}

.EE

.SS ssh
.PP
Shows a list of SSH targets based on your \fBssh\fR config file, and allows to
quickly \fBssh\fR into them.

.SS keys
.PP
Shows a searchable list of key bindings.

.SS script
.PP
Allows custom scripted Modes to be added, see the \fBrofi-script(5)\fP manpage
for more information.

.SS combi
.PP
Combines multiple modes in one list. Specify which modes are included with the
\fB-combi-modes\fR option.

.PP
When using the combi mode, a \fI!bang\fP can be used to filter the results by modes.
All modes that match the bang as a prefix are included.
For example, say you have specified \fB-combi-modes run,window,windowcd\fR\&. If your
query begins with the bang \fB!w\fR, only results from the \fBwindow\fR and \fBwindowcd\fR
modes are shown, even if the rest of the input text would match results from \fBrun\fR\&.

.PP
If no match, the input is handled by the first combined modes.

.SH FAQ
.SS The text in the window switcher is not nicely aligned
.PP
Try using a mono-space font or tabs + the tab-stops setting..

.SS The window is completely black
.PP
Check quotes used on the command-line: you might have used \fB“\fR ("smart quotes")
instead of \fB"\fR ("machine quotes").

.SS What does the icon in the top right show?
.PP
The indicator shows:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
 Case insensitive and no sorting.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB-\fR Case sensitivity enabled, no sorting.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB+\fR Case insensitive and Sorting enabled
.IP \(bu 2
\fB±\fR Sorting and Case sensitivity enabled"

.RE

.SS Why do I see different icons for run,drun and window mode
.PP
Each of these modes uses different methods of resolving the icon:

.RS
.IP \(bu 2
Window: It first uses the icon that the application exposes via the X11
Server, if none is set it does a lookup of the window Class name in the icon
theme.
.IP \(bu 2
drun: It uses the icon set in the desktop file.
.IP \(bu 2
run: It does a lookup using the executable name.

.EX
    rofi -e "<span color='red'><b>This is still the end</b></span>" -markup

.EE

.PP
Show all key bindings:

.EX
    rofi -show keys

.EE

.SH i3
.PP
In i3
\[la]http://i3wm.org/\[ra] you want to bind \fBrofi\fP to be launched on key
release. Otherwise, it cannot grab the keyboard. See also the i3
manual
\[la]http://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html\[ra]:

.PP
Some tools (such as \fBimport\fR or \fBxdotool\fR) might be unable to run upon a
KeyPress event, because the keyboard/pointer is still grabbed. For these
situations, the \fB--release\fR flag can be used, as it will execute the command
after the keys have been released.
